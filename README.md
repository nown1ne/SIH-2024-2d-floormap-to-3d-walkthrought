## üöÄ **About the Project**  
In the realm of national security, precision and efficiency are critical. Our project addresses the challenge of converting 2D blueprints into immersive 3D walkthroughs to aid the National Security Guard (NSG) in executing high-stakes operations inside sensitive buildings such as schools, metro stations, and more.  

This solution transforms static 2D layouts into actionable, interactive 3D spaces, empowering ground forces with a clear understanding of the target layout.

## üåü **Why Minecraft? A Journey Through Innovation**  

At the start, we explored platforms like **Blender** and **Unity** for creating 3D walkthroughs:  
- üêå **Performance Issues**: Both tools struggled to handle large, complex building models efficiently.  
- üèóÔ∏è **No Floor Stacking**: Adding multiple floors and creating interconnected layouts became unnecessarily tedious.  
- ü•æ **Rigid Walkthroughs**: The user experience was clunky, making it hard to navigate the 3D space intuitively.  
- üîß **Lack of Flexibility**: Customizing layouts or integrating real-world maps was cumbersome.  

Faced with these limitations, we turned to **Minecraft**, and the results were astounding:  
- **‚ö° High Efficiency**: Minecraft handles large structures seamlessly, with optimized performance.  
- **üè† Floor-by-Floor Stacking**: Creating and stacking multiple floors was straightforward and customizable.  
- **üéÆ Immersive Walkthrough**: Minecraft‚Äôs interactive gameplay allowed for a realistic and intuitive exploration of 3D spaces.  
- **üîó Flexibility & Simplicity**: Easy integration of blueprints and parameters with a simple command-based system.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Key Features**  
1. **üñºÔ∏è 2D to 3D Conversion**  
   - Converts 2D blueprint layouts into fully functional 3D walkthroughs.  
   - Accepts floor plans as input along with parameters like dimensions, staircases, and entry/exit points.  

2. **üèóÔ∏è Minecraft Integration**  
   - Generates a behavior pack with `.mcfunction` commands for Minecraft.  
   - Allows seamless execution within Minecraft to visualize and explore the 3D layout.  

3. **üåê Offline Functionality**  
   - Operable in standalone mode without requiring internet connectivity.  
   - Fetches maps and satellite imagery during the initial setup for offline use.  

4. **üß† Enhanced Briefing Efficiency**  
   - Accelerates the understanding of target layouts.  
   - Reduces briefing time for ground forces, boosting operational success rates.

## üßë‚Äçüíª **How It Works**  
1. **üì∏ Image Processing**  
   - Uses computer vision to process floor maps and identify color-coded sections representing walls, doors, windows, and more.  

2. **üåê Flask Backend**  
   - Accepts 2D blueprints and user inputs via a web interface.  
   - Dynamically generates `.mcfunction` commands based on the blueprint and parameters.  

3. **üéÆ Minecraft Visualization**  
   - The behavior pack is imported into Minecraft.  
   - Troops can interactively explore the building with realistic proportions and layouts.

## üîë **Key Benefits**  
- **‚è±Ô∏è Saves Time**: Faster conversion from blueprints to walkthroughs.  
- **üõ°Ô∏è Better Preparedness**: Troops have a clear and immersive understanding of the target layout before operations.  
- **üéÆ Realistic Experience**: A dynamic and interactive environment for planning.  

---

## üéâ **Future Scope**  
- **üåê Enhanced Map Integration**: Support for more detailed offline maps and satellite imagery.  
- **ü§ñ AI Automation**: Automating the entire process with minimal human intervention.  
- **üöÄ Deployment**: Scaling the solution for real-world NSG operations and beyond.
